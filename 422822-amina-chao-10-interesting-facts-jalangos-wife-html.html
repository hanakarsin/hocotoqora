Yet, for the longest time, it never seemed like he was the kind of person eager to find a better half and make a life-long commitment until he met Amina Chao. To some people, he was just another playboy in town swimming in the fortunes begotten from his blossoming career as a comedian and media personality. However, the controversy under the hashtag Jalang'o's Boys Club revealed the mindset of netizens who believe that the comedian cannot sustain a marriage, but he continues to prove them wrong.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/0ecfb772cb482ef3.jpeg><p class=align-left>Little was known about Amina Chao before she hooked up with Jalang’o.

The two have had their ups and downs to the point where rumours claimed they had separated. Here are interesting facts about Jalang'o's wife:</p><h3>1. She married Jalang’o in 2019</h3><p class=align-left>Chao and Jalang'o exchanged their vows on the 26th of October, 2019. The traditional <a href=#>wedding </a>was graced by friends and <a href=#>family</a>. The colourful ceremony was held in Syokimau on the outskirts of Nairobi.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0e0871512c0ab888.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pascal Tokodi biography: wife, movies, siblings, parents, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Notable guests who attended include Jalang'o's friends Alex Mwakideu, Tom Japanni, MC Jessy, Chris Kirwa, and Big Ted. The couple has been married for close to two years now.</p><h3>2. Amina Chao is a Muslim</h3><p class=align-left>Amina is one of the brave people not to let religion stand in her way to marry the person she love. Typically, she would have been expected to marry someone with whom they share the Muslim belief. However, that did not stop her from breaking the tradition and dating a man who does not share her faith and even married him.</p><p class=align-left>In an interview, Jalang'o revealed that he is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">not a religious guy </a>and hardly goes to church. He, however, can't resist the temptation to enter and pray when he passes by a <a href=#>church </a>playing good music.</p><h3>3. She is a Safaricom employee</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b786df4451649b89.jpeg><p class=align-left>Unlike most wives of celebrities who sit at home and rely on their husbands' money for upkeep, Amina has a promising career that can cater for her needs. By the time she got married, she was already an employee of telecommunication giant <a href=#>Safaricom</a>. She falls under the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">General Trade Visibility and Events Department</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5886fa324be59c63.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nabayet: interesting facts about Otile Brown's Ethiopian lover</span></p></a><h3>4. Amina is an alumnus of USIU</h3><p class=align-left>It is a tale of beauty with grains when it comes to Amina Chao. She attended the prestigious United States International University – Africa (USIU). She studied for a Bachelor of Arts Degree in International Relations and Affairs at the institution.</p><h3>5. She gets along with Jalang’o’s ex, Cheptoek</h3><p class=align-left>It is almost unheard of to have an ex-girlfriend and the current girlfriend getting along. Usually, an ex is bitter that the current girlfriend stole her man, and the two tend not to see eye to eye. However, one thing that shows Amina is not a typical everyday girl is her ability to have a good relationship with Cheptoek.</p><p class=align-left>Before he started seeing Amina, Jalang'o was in a relationship with Cheptoek Boyo, with whom they had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two children</a>. However, the relationship did not work out, and as a result, they went their separate ways. Cheptoek moved on with her life but has also maintained a good relationship with Jalang’o and Amina.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b4074230ae32c0b6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Prema Mutiso: 5 quick facts about Bennet Omalu's Kenyan wife</span></p></a><h3>6. She is a mother</h3><p class=align-left>Jalang'o and Amina have been married for about two years. In this duration, he has been constantly under pressure from fans who wanted him to get Amina pregnant, but he remained silent about the matter. The comedian revealed on his YouTube channel, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jalango TV</a>, that the two became parents long ago.</p>Kila mtu amekuwa akisema patia bibi mimba, patia bibi mimba, tulifunga hiyo mambo kitambo, only that I don’t post my children on social media.<h3>7. Amina and Cheptoek co-parent</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0e0871512c0ab888.jpeg><p class=align-left>Amina and Jalang'o's ex (Cheptoek) do not only get along well, but they also co-parent. This speaks to the character of Amina, who has no problem with being there for Jalang'o's children with his baby mama. The ex-girlfriend revealed that it has been fun interacting with Amina. This has been possible because they have prioritized the well-being of the children and put aside their issues.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0155f6ead782ff09.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nahreel biography: wife, parents, net worth, songs, facts</span></p></a><h3>8. She hails from the Coast</h3><p class=align-left>Amina comes from <a href=#>Mombasa County</a>, which is home to the second-biggest city in the country. Her ethnicity is Taita revealing yet another beautiful thing about the family. Jalang'o is from Nyanza, but love brought the two people from different worlds together. While Amina is a Taita which is Bantu, Jalang'o is Nilote from the Luo tribe.</p><h3>9. Amina named her first son Jamail</h3><p class=align-left>Jalang'o is quite the romantic man who would do anything for his queen. They named their son Jamail Edward, a Muslim name, to honour Amina being a Muslim. Naming children is an excellent deal because both parents usually have different ideas and want the names of their kin to be given to their children.</p><p class=align-left>To balance the equation, their second child will probably have a Christian name. As for Jamail, names may not have too much significance at his age. That is why he prefers calling himself King Otuchi. Otuchi is the name of his grandfather.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2bc0373a9bb4c86b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shilole biography: husband, family, net worth, songs, life story</span></p></a><h3>10. She is not active on social media</h3><p class=align-left>There are no official social media accounts associated with Amina Chao revealing that she is not immersed in the online <a href=#>world</a>. Likewise, Jalang'o's wife Instagram presence has been limited to a handful of photos. The same applies to all other social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.</p><p class=align-left>Her husband has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2.4 million followers</a> on Instagram alone, making him one of the most popular Kenyans on social media. However, given Amina's fashion consciousness, she could have had as many followers as she chose to be an active social media user.</p><p class=align-left>Amina Chao has become a fan-favourite and role model to many people who admire how she conducts herself. She remains a humble person despite being married to one of the biggest celebrities in the country. She is also a family-oriented person, as evidenced by her willingness to fight for her union with Jalang'o.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/91b85ecd263a1701.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mr Blue biography: family, net worth, songs, facts and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>shared an interesting piece about <a href=#>Kate Silverton</a>.

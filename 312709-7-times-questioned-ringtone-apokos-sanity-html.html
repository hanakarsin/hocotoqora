As a musician, he is quite talented with many hits that have made him one of the most successful gospel artistes in the country. He is also successful in courting controversy and all its relatives. Media attention is his opium and his hunger to make headlines has led to stunts that did not impress the majority of Kenyans. Ringtone Apoko’s wealth has always been a subject of public inquiry with many Kenyans feeling that the story does not add up, but other controversies have always taken center stage when his name is mentioned. It, therefore, should not come as a surprise when Kenyan’s question Ringtone Apoko’s sanity.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/45bae24c1c9a3344.jpeg><p class=align-left>Ringtone Apoko’s scandals aside, he is one of the most inspirational gospel singers in the country. The story of Ringtone is a touching and captivating one. Coming from a humble beginning, many Kenyans had a reason to feel touched and accept him as a testimony of how God can make something out of nothing. Apoko was abandoned by his parents at a very young age and left at the care of his grandmother. Life was unbearable, thus prompting the young Apoko to opt for life in the streets.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7d408cdf089310d8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars? What you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Life was not easy walk being a street boy. Perhaps it is this background that has made Ringtone accustomed to controversies and not conforming to societal expectations. While the hardships are a thing of the past, his decisions have often been questioned by mainstream media.</p><h2>1. Ringtone Says Willy Paul not fit for gospel industry</h2><p class=align-left>In the past Ringtone has publicly come out denouncing fellow gospel musician as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">not being fit</a> for the gospel industry. According to the controversial Ringtone, there is a certain standard that gospel musicians have to uphold, and he seems to be the one to determine that standard. Going by what he claims to be, Ringtone should, therefore, be at the forefront of promoting peace and unity.</p><p class=align-left>His actions speak otherwise as he seems not to be walking the talk. He has set himself apart, making almost everything ‘him against them’. Somehow Ringtone is the caretaker of the secrets of many musicians. He claims that Nandy aborted Willy Paul’s baby. What’s more, Ringtone claimed that the story originated from Willy Paul but then why would he post it on his Instagram? The story could only bring hate between Willy Paul and Nandy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3dc98ceedb294ac6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jimmy Gait sickness - fake or real?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The real question here is how did Ringtone get wind of all that information? The two artists involved in the allegations were wise enough to keep quiet about the news, thus not giving Apoko more room to advance his conspiracies. Kenyans, on the other hand, were not amused by Ringtone’s conduct. Many were of the view that the musician ought to seek mental help because he is mad.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Trending celebrity news: Diamond Platnumz's wedding, Ben Pol's engagement, Otile brown's new song</p><h3>2.&nbsp;A brand new Range Rover for Zari</h3><p class=align-left>For the longest time Ringtone has been hunting for a wife. Whether that is true remains to be seen. It is not common to find such a successful person on many fronts, not being able to find a wife. Usually, one would expect a person such as Ringtone to be spoilt for choice when it comes to selecting a wife. The gospel singer claims the opposite of that.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3eb705906f251577.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>John De Mathew songs list and videos</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When Zari broke up with Diamond, the Kenyan musicians could not let the opportunity slip by him. Just as headlines of the Diamond- Zari split were hot, Ringtone was already in the media <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">professing his love</a> for the South Africa based Ugandan socialite. Ringtone was convinced or made people believe that God had shown him that Zari is the one. Ringtone did not stop at that, he went as far as saying that he would lead Zari to God.</p><p class=align-left>About that time, Zari happened to be visiting Kenya. Ringtone claimed to have bought a brand new range rover for Zari as a sign if his love. The problem is that Ringtone and Zari had never met before, and as such, he couldn’t claim to have loved her. Furthermore, Zari has her own money and cars, and a Range Rover wouldn’t do the trick if Ringtone was serious about wanting to impress her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8171740444f9650.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kush Tracey: 10 hottest photos you should check out</span></p></a><h2>3. Chairman of gospel musicians</h2><p class=align-left>Apparently, there is a chairman of the Gospel musicians of Kenya and it is none other than Ringtone Apoko himself. That would be nice if he was elected to such a post, but that did not happen. In fact, neither was he nominated nor endorsed for such a position.</p><p class=align-left>The musician imposed the title on himself, and other gospel musicians knew better not to give the attention he was seeking. He first came out with the story of him being chairman while addressing the beef between Mr. Seed and Bahati. As usual, Ringtone saw an opportunity for attention, and he jumped on it. It was a nasty exchange between Mr. Seed and Bahati that ended with Mr. Seed parting ways with his boss.</p><p class=align-left>As the ‘chairman of gospel musicians’ Ringtone should have been the mediator and try to reconcile the two. On the contrary, Ringtone went from one Radio station to another and accused Bahati not showing gratitude to pioneers in the industry such as himself. When questioned on who appointed him as the chairman of gospel artists, he responded that he only assumed the position since one was there.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bbddd19b5e29f3e5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Erick Omondi and Madini Classic feud: Everything to know</span></p></a><h2>4. A herder in Karen</h2><p class=align-left>Naturally, one would not expect to a herd of 40 cows grazing by the roadside in Karen. It is a quiet estate where some of the wealthiest people in Kenya live. Having one or two cows in a zero-grazing unit is sensible, but rearing 40 of them is a different story altogether. That is why Kenyans could not believe when Ringtone claimed that he had 40 cows in his Karen residence.</p><p class=align-left>Ringtone shared a letter on social media, claiming that the Karen Resident’s Association would take legal action against him for keeping the cows in the estate. The letter alleges that several residents had complained hence he had to act swiftly. Amid the warning letter, the association found time to express their joy in having a celebrity living amongst them.</p><p class=align-left>Somehow, they also managed to inform Ringtone that they love his music-making a section of Kenyans to doubt the authenticity of the letter. It would emerge that the letter was fake. There is no Karen Residents Association. Instead, there is a Karen Lang’ata District Association. Such are the lengths the musician can go in an attempt to remain relevant.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs343lcbe8p0kg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Do you know Christina Shusho Husband? Here's the bio</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Latest celebrity news: Diamond Platnumz, Size 8, Otile Brown, Ann Kansiime & more</p><h2>5. Quest to find love</h2><p class=align-left>The Ringtone Apoko looking for a wife story has been around for a while. Apoko announcing his love on the radio, did not start with Zari. Years before, Apoko had announced that he wanted to marry Tanzanian musician Ray C. Ray C was also hunting for a partner at the time, but she rejected Ringtone’s offer.</p><p class=align-left>In an attempt to shove his humiliation, Apoko claimed that he was not interested in marrying that Tanzanian hitmaker. It has, however, become a trend where Apoko claims to want to marry a woman saying that he is inspired by God to do so. Now, the singer has taken his search for a wife to another level. Initially, he was only making his intention known through the media. He has since taken to the streets with a placard asking women to marry him.</p><p class=align-left>A section of media claims that Ringtone was recently arrested outside Co-operative University while looking for a wife. The reports claimed that he was arrested for causing confusion and promoting prostitution. He claims to be looking for a God-fearing, prayerful, hardworking and humble woman for a wife but Kenyans have been quick to write him off as an attention seeker.</p><h2>6.&nbsp;A priest and a spiritual husband</h2><p class=align-left>After failing to woo Zari and make her his wife, Ringtone pulled another stunt claiming that he had opted to be a priest. His energy was focused on becoming a priest something even he knew that many would not believe. He even posted photos on Instagram of himself dressed as a priest, but it would later come to light that he was only shooting a video for a song.</p><p class=align-left>Fast forward and Apoko can’t seem to stop his quest for a wife. Once again he claimed to have had an interest in another celebrity. This time it was Tanzania’s, Jacqueline Wolper. According to the singer, Wolper is his wife spiritually. He was hopeful that his friendship with the top actress from Tanzania will end in marriage.</p><p class=align-left>As is the case with his stunts, it emerged that he was doing all this in preparation for his song titled Natafuta Bibi. Jacqueline Wolper is a video vixen in the song’s video, and the claim was only a way of marketing the song.</p><h2>7. Shutting the door on Stevo Simple Boy</h2><p class=align-left>Self-righteousness is not the best trait for someone who claims to be born again. It is because such a person is expected to be humble and respect all people regardless of who they are. It seems Apoko has passed judgment on who is worthy of being a gospel singer and who is not. He made headlines recently for condemning Willy Paul after the former decided to shift from gospel to secular music.</p><p class=align-left>Apoko did not take this lightly, making it known that he was opposed to the kind of music Willy Paul had decided to make. Apoko has come under heavy criticism for his outbursts towards Stevo Simple Boy. Stevo Simple Boy is an upcoming artist who was also on the receiving end after Apoko labeled him a ‘Mihadarati Singer’ and not a gospel singer.</p><p class=align-left>Apoko issued a stern warning that Stevo Simple Boy should stick to secular music after the new musician released a gospel song. He claimed that before doing any gospel music, Stevo Simple Boy should declare to be a born again Christian and make it known where he goes to church. The gospel industry has no shortage of musicians according to Ringtone, and therefore, newcomers have to be vetted.</p><p class=align-left>Whenever Ringtone Apoko opens his mouth to speak or posts on social media, he tends to leave people with many questions than answers. If it is not about his source of wealth, it would be about his quest to find a wife or an attempt to intervene on some trending subject. He has the uncanny habit of throwing himself in the middle of other people’s storms without minding about the repercussions. A section of Kenyans believes that Apoko is depressed while others suggest that he should visit a mental institution and have himself checked.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Trending Celebrity news: Diamond's new song, Bahati's troubles and more</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkGtuaXFdbHq1tcyeqmappZrAtbXOp5ydZaKeu6jAzqecZpmgpLiwv4ysmKehpK57qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1392731-don-jazzy-supports-young-nigerian-artist-buys-work-n300k-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Don Jazzy supports young Nigerian artist, buys his work for N300k">&larr;

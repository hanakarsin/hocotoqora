I stand before you as a Pan-Nigerian of northern origin.”</p><h2>He Is An Ethnic Bigot</h2><p>Onanuga warned against voting Atiku whom he accused of disrespecting his party’s zoning arrangement because of his selfish, personal interest.</p><p>“In clear terms, Atiku who stole the PDP ticket, by a similar mindset, has cast himself as a northern candidate, who should solely be supported by the people from his region.</p><p>“We view Atiku’s public declaration which framed him as an ethnic and regional champion as unbecoming for a man who was once a former Vice-President of Nigeria.</p><p>“But we are not surprised by his desperate position. Atiku has resorted to whipping up ethnic sentiments, knowing that his chances of being elected have become a mirage.”</p><h2>Atiku’s Many Sins</h2><p>The APC stalwart went ahead to highlight some of the things the PDP candidate has done wrong in the race for the 2023 presidency.</p><p>Onanuga said Nigerians however can’t be deceived as they have seen through the person of Atiku as someone who can’t be trusted to represent them well at the highest political office in the land.</p><p>He predicted a loss for Atiku at the polls.</p><p>“He has himself, not anybody else, to blame for his expected electoral misfortune. First, he broke the fundamental rules of power rotation in his party and the country,” the statement continued.</p><p>“As if this cardinal sin was not enough, the PDP candidate has remained defiant in the face of pressure by preserving the two topmost posts in his party for people from his region.</p><p>“The Nigerian public now know better that a man who has been campaigning as a so-called unifier of our disparate groups, is a tribal jingoist, who has now totally eviscerated all pretensions to being a detribalised Nigerian.</p><p>“He is demonstrably the anti-thesis of a pan-Nigerian politician. Nigerians of goodwill, who, daily, seek a united and prosperous nation, should reject Atiku and his party at the polls next February.</p><p>“Atiku only pays lip service to national unity, despite that it features as one of the 5 cardinal points of his so-called “Covenant with Nigerians”. The facade is over, he is now fully naked before the Nigerian people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BvZqenoqm1pr7NZqernaOesaa602aaqKWdmru1ecCtoKStXajBsLjEZqedqF2ptqS3xK1koZ1dnsBuus6wZKeZm5qxbq7En6arnV2jtqix0aKYp6tdlr2kecKapKmZmZy7bq%2FOrqWcoZxk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./505224-main-problem-majek-fashek-not-drug-veteran-raggae-artiste-reveals-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Problem With Majek Fashek Is Not Drug - Orits Wiliki">&larr;

The short videos, viral challenges, uncannily astute algorithm, and collaborative nature of the app all come together to make it feel as though the people you follow are truly connected to your real life. And in so many ways, they are! That also means that in the tragic event of a TikToker’s death, the grief can have a ripple effect upon thousands of people.</p><p>On August 1, 2021, followers of TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Timbo the Redneck</a> (real name Timothy Isaiah Hall) received a tragic update when Timothy’s mother shared a video announcing that her son had died in a “bad accident.” Here’s what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to TikTok user Timbo the Redneck?</h2><p>In the video Timothy’s mother shared on TikTok, she stated that her son “was in a bad accident” and “didn’t make it.” She went on to tearfully thank his many fans and followers, saying that they had been a huge part of why he loved making content for the video-sharing app. “He loved TikTok and just believed in the fans and everybody who supported him. It meant a lot to him,” she said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@timbotheredneck href=#>@timbotheredneck</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Timothy" href=#>♬ original sound - Timothy</a></figure><p>Timothy had gained a following of more than 200,000 followers and had more than 2 million likes shared across his many TikTok videos depicting his “redneck” life in the U.S. south. His videos included clips of him fishing, doing stunts in his truck, and discussing his habit of chewing tobacco. According to his Instagram posts, he graduated from high school in May of 2021.</p><p>After the news of Timbo’s reported death came to light, his accounts were flooded with messages from his fans. “Great guy. Loved talking video ideas with you Timbo. You made videos to put smiles on people’s faces,” one wrote. “Your son seems like he was a cool guy, one day we’ll all get to see him. May he Rest In Peace,” said another.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Timothy’s brother-in-law Tony provided additional details about Timbo’s cause of death.</h2><p>In a video uploaded to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Timbo the Redneck’s YouTube channel</a>, Tony — who says he is Timothy’s brother-in-law — provided some additional details regarding Timbo’s reported death. “He was doing donuts in the front yard at JD’s house … with his girlfriend, and the truck just flipped over and he flew out [of] the driver’s side window and the truck landed on him,” Tony said. He went on to say that Timbo had not survived the incident.</p><p>Tony also talked about how important TikTok was to Timothy. ““I just want everybody to know that Timbo … truly appreciated and loved his fans and he loved his friends,” he said. “He was a small-town boy from Jennings, Fla. and he started getting on TikTok and started posting all these videos and you guys were commenting and laughing with him … he appreciated you guys so much more than you know.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Timothy’s family started a GoFundMe campaign to help pay for his funeral.</h2><p>In the video from Timothy’s mother, she says that they had set up a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe campaign</a> in order to cover the expenses of Timothy’s funeral. At this time, it looks as though the campaign is no longer accepting donations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStoZ2XvG7Ax55kq52Uo7Kkt4ytoKSsn6A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./she-hulk-trailer-breakdown.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Breakdown of Marvel's New She-Hulk Trailer">&larr;

Assembly, Matthew Iduoriyekemwen has knocked the decision of the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike not to support the campaigns of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>Iduoriyekemwen in his submission stated that Wike’s action is unbecoming of a leader and politician of his calibre, arguing that the Rivers Governor had made his stand known and should have left the stage when the ovation was loudest.</p><p>The Edo State politician added that the PDP has always given Wike the platform to actualize his political ambitions and the first time a ticket he wants would go to another person, the Governor wants to tear the party apart.</p><p>Wike and his loyalists including some state governors had vowed not to participate in Atiku’s presidential campaigns except Iyorchia Ayu resigns as the PDP national chairman.</p><p>They argued that Atiku’s emergence as the PDP flagbearer has put the major leadership positions in the north which negates the principle of justice and fairness.</p><p>Wike Is Selfish<br>However, asked about the development and how it would affect the fortunes of the PDP in 2023, Iduoriyekemwen during an interview with Punch blamed Wike for the crisis which he described as unnecessary.</p><p>He questioned Wike’s action saying it was probably because he lost the PDP presidential ticket.</p><p><strong><a href=#

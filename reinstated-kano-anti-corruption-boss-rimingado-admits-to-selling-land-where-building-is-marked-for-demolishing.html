This thing that the government is doing is not the way out. A leader protects the lives and properties of his people. That place was given to big men in the state at that time.</p><p>“His (Rimingado) plot was number 25 opposite Gidauniya just by Hauren Shanu. And if you are talking about Badala, the Gidan Murtala building was built on Badala and the other buildings beside it are all on Badala.</p><p>“There is no reason (for the demolition) and it does not make sense because we got it from the previous government that it should be demolished.</p><p>“There is a place I bought, it was a pond that has claimed so many lives. I bought it from Gwaggo the wife of the late Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero, the in-law of former Emir, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi and the deposed emir gave her the place.</p><p>“I went to her house in her sitting room and bought it. I came back and filled it with sand. We demolished Badala inside the pond and found out that some youth have created a room inside. We found guns and other dangerous weapons. The police at zone one is aware. They took the items. The residents there thanked me immensely for that.”</p><p>However, in his reaction to the allegation, Rimingado admitted selling the land to them truly and according to him, it was because the land was not situated in or around a school or worship centre and did not affect the ancient Kano city wall.</p><p>He told Daily Trust that&nbsp;it was mischievous for anyone to try to use the recent development to cast aspersions on him and the government.</p><p>The anti-graft boss also confirmed that he was allocated a plot around the area marked for demolition but he had sold it, “when in need of money.” And he was sure the land was not within or built on the Kano ancient wall (Badala).</p><p>He submitted that “Marking for demolition is a different thing as it is not within a school, place of worship or hospital. As far as I am concerned the governor can issue a plot of land for anyone but a governor cannot issue a public space for anyone. I stand by my position (on Trust TV).</p><p>“I don’t know why they marked that place for demolition. And the owner of the property can take it up with the government for clarification.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5FuZqudmaPAta3Tnptmo5GjvG6tza2gZpufp7%2B2vNOipqdlkqTAtHnRoqSippeWsbB5wJ2koqyjYsGwedKeo6Whnpx6ra3NnWSwoJWnsm6u1KKjnaGenHqqv4ymmKujlZl6p7vRZpuepZ%2BhtrS0yKeeaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1117938-anna-banner-picks-father-date-attends-mbgn-event-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anna Banner picks her father as date as she attends MBGN event">&larr;

Even though less is known about his <a href=#>family</a>, he has confessed his parents were Jewish. Due to the unfortunate relationship between Germany and Jews, he moved to the UK in his teens.</p><p class=align-left>Later, he moved from the UK to the USA to pursue his dreams. Thanks to his experience in different cultures, he prefers to call himself a global citizen. However, his accent has a heavy German influence, thanks to his early life in Germany.</p><h2>Hans Zimmer’s education</h2><p class=align-left>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reddit AMAs</a>, the composer confessed that he went to eight schools as a young boy. While the cause of moving schools is not related to indiscipline cases, he did not like the mode of teaching, especially in most German schools. Ecole D’Humanite was Hans Zimmer’s school before relocating to the UK.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/44a1c83012c4c607.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Percy Gibson: Net worth, nationality, career, wedding, family</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When he relocated to the UK as a teenager, he continued his education at the prestigious Hurtwood House school. However, the best school, according to him, was his home in Franfruit. He grew up in a home with pianos, and the presence of the musical instrument gave him access to music composing.</p><p class=align-left>Where did Hans Zimmer go to college? The award-winning composer did not go to college. On multiple platforms, he has confessed that he is self-taught. Also, Hans has never liked formal music training as he terms it ‘boring’ and uninspiring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/71763a77e2fb6a3f.jpeg><h2>Marriage and family</h2><p class=align-left>The award-winning composer is single as of 2021. However, he has been married twice. First, Hans married Vicki Caroline, a model. However, due to differences, they divorced in the early 1990s. A few years later, Hans married Suzanne Zimmer. Unfortunately, he filed a divorce in April 2020.</p><p class=align-left>In his two marriages, Hans has four children. He has a daughter from his first marriage and three children from his union with Suzanne Zimmer. Even though the marriages did not survive, the music producer is involved in his children’s lives.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e9317e92b32a32d7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Daniel Levy: Sexuality, spouse, family, net worth, Schitt's Creek</span></p></a><h2>Work</h2><p class=align-left>In more than four decades, Hans has been an active <a href=#>musician </a>and composer. However, his music has evolved over the years. Some of his career highlights include:</p><h3>As a piano player for different bands</h3><p class=align-left>In the late 1970s, London was home to young <a href=#>bands</a> from across Europe. Thanks to his music background, Hans found a home in the growing bands’ scene. His first experience was playing with Krakatoa as a keyboard player and one of the composers.</p><p class=align-left>The young Hans also played for the Buggles, one of the most influential bands in 1970’s London. Besides playing for the band, he appeared in the band’s first music video titled <i>Video Killed the Radio Star</i>. Later he played for The Damned, a punk band from the UK.</p><h3>As a composer for advertising jingles</h3><p class=align-left>After playing for bands, Hans needed a new challenge. Air-Edel Associates recruited him to their advertising firm as a jingles <a href=#>writer</a> and producer. Besides giving him access to the commercial <a href=#>world</a>, producing commercial jingles helped him polish his skills as a young producer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f5bc9d589a4dfb27.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Boris Sanchez bio: wife, children, nationality, body, eyebrows</span></p></a><h3>As a young film score composer in London</h3><p class=align-left>After working for the Air-Edel Associates for some years, Hans left to try out his newfound passion, producing for <a href=#>movies</a>.

He also wrote<a href=#> songs </a>for The Last Empire and Terminal Exposure.</p><h3>As a full-time composer in Hollywood</h3><p class=align-left>After working in the UK for a decade, Hans had his first breakthrough.

His most famous project with the production company is creating the soundtrack for <i>The Lion King</i>. Besides the film winning awards, it opened another door for Hans to travel across the world and collect different sounds.</p><p class=align-left>He has also worked with other productions in the 2000s. For example, he was part of the production team for the Gladiator in 2000 and The Last Samurai. However, unlike before, he has a different work approach. Hans prefers working from his home as opposed to traveling with other production crews.</p><p class=align-left>Where is Hans Zimmer’s studio? His main studio is in his home. Due to his work routine, he prefers having all the equipment around him. So, when he gets an idea, he does not need to travel to record as he can comfortably record it in the comfort of his home.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d6fe50239b2439e5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Fantasia's husband?

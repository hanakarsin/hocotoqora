style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspaper headlines in Nigeria for today, Monday, 26th September 2022</h2><p>Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has said the Muhammadu Buhari-led government has performed better than past administrations.</p><p>Naija News reports that Governor Bello stated this during an interview on a pre-recorded programme on Channels Television, Newsnight.</p><p>The governor stated that the Buhari government has largely solved most of the security challenges it met when it assumed power in 2015, adding that the administration is facing emerging threats.</p><p>He also commended the Buhari government for improving the equipment of security agencies as well as taking care of the welfare of personnel.</p><p>Former President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan has cautioned citizens against voting the wrong set of persons into power in 2023.</p><p>He said with the wrong set of people in power, the citizens will continue to suffer.</p><p>Jonathan stressed that those who kill in order to get into power will continue to kill to remain in power and therefore cautioned Nigerians against voting for such people during the the2023 elections.</p><p>Naija News reports the former President made the submission on Sunday while speaking in Uyo during a special interdenominational service to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the creation of Akwa Ibom State.</p><p>Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has taken President Muhammadu Buhari and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN) to court over the agreement between Nigeria and the United States for the repatriated $23 million stolen by Sani Abacha.</p><p>Naija News reports that the United States government had in August signed an agreement with the Federal Government to repatriate $23 million Abacha loot to Nigeria.</p><p>It is understood that the $23 million adds to the $311.7 million Abacha loot repatriated from the U.S. to Nigeria in 2020.</p><p>The suit FHC/ABJ/CS/1700/2022, filed at the Federal High Court, Abuja, is asking the court to direct the President and Malami to make the details of how the fund would be managed public.</p><p>The group wants to know the mechanisms and processes put in place to ensure the funds are not stolen or disbursed inadequately.</p><p>SERAP insisted that the repatriated $23 million could also be mismanagement as a large amount of $5 billion returned Abacha loot since 1999 remains unaccounted for.</p><p>The suit filed by Kolawole Oluwadare and Atinuke Adejuyigbe relies on the Nigerian Constitution, the Freedom of Information Act, and the country’s international obligations.</p><p>Former Ogun State Governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun has distanced himself from any pact with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its Governorship Candidate in Ogun State, Dr. Ladi Adebutu.</p><p>Naija News reports that Amosun was reacting to media reports on leaked documents where Adebutu and Amosun’s former loyalist, Adekunle Akinlade, reportedly signed an alliance agreement on the sharing formula of positions after their victory at the 2023 polls.</p><p>The alliance agreement is titled, “The Alliance Agreement between Dr. Oladipupo Olatunde Adebutu and Adekunle Abdulkabir Akinlade in respect of the 2023 elections into the office of Governor, Deputy Governor, related elective positions and appointments in Ogun State, Nigeria.”</p><p>According to the agreement, the Deputy Governor, Ogun West Senatorial Ticket, and Two House of Assembly Tickets (Ogun Central) will be given by Adebutu and the PDP to Akinlade and his APM group.</p><p>After winning the 2023 governorship election, Adebutu and the PDP will concede seven substantive commissioner slots, 15 special adviser slots, 20 senior special assistant slots, 20 special assistant slots, five statutory board chairman slots, and five local government executive chairman slots.</p><p>Reacting in a statement issued by his media aide, Bola Adeyemi, on Sunday, Amosun described the report as false, claiming that it was aimed at tarnishing his reputation.</p><p>A power bloc in the Presidential Villa may have reportedly succeeded in excluding the immediate past Senate President, Bukola Saraki, for those to be honoured by President Muhammadu Buhari with a national award during events to mark Nigeria’s 62nd independence anniversary.</p><p>Naija News reports that the investiture ceremony is billed to hold at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.</p><p>It was gathered that a Vice President, Senate President, and Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) are normally given national titles either on the assumption of office or when national awards are being generally bestowed on recipients.</p><p>According to The PUNCH, the committee set up by the Federal Government to recommend deserving Nigerians to the Presidency, enlisted Saraki, but he was denied a place on the list by a cabal in the presidency.</p><p>The Aso Villa power bloc reportedly labelled Saraki an “enemy of the administration,” arguing that the All Progressives Congress-led government should rather give it to other deserving Nigerians.</p><p>Kicking against the position of the cabal, another group argued that though Saraki’s opposition to some of the policy decisions taken by Buhari while serving as Senate President was well documented; he should not be denied a place in the 2022 honour list.</p><p>The group pointed out that Saraki’s successor, Senator Ahmad Lawan is also set to bag the prestigious award next week.</p><p>According to the group, Bukola Saraki is more popular with the people and is credited to have achieved more while in office.</p><p>The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi on Sunday visited former Nigerian Head of State, Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida (IBB).</p><p>Obi visited Babangida at his residence in Minna, Niger State in the company of his running mate, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, Naija News reports.</p><p>The LP candidate made the disclosure via a post on the micro-blogging site, Twitter.</p><p>The visit is understood to be part of consultations for their 2023 presidential ambition.</p><p>Obi disclosed that during the visit, they had insightful conversations on the state of affairs in Nigeria.</p><p>Obi in the statement also appreciated Babangida for hosting them and giving fatherly counsel.</p><p>Some residents of Fakai in the Shinkafi Local Government Area of Zamfara State have appealed to the government and military authorities to stop the airstrike bombardments against terrorist kingpin, Bello Turji.</p><p>The residents expressed that though they are not in support of banditry, the camp of the terrorists has been upholding their end of the bargain in protecting them since they’ve been paying their dues.</p><p>They expressed worries that with the ongoing bombardment by the military, the terrorists may turn against them and unsettle the relative peaceful arrangement they’ve been enjoying.</p><p>According to them, it is better to allow sleeping dogs lie.</p><p>The Zamfara community residents have however appealed for a cease-fire out of fear that they may be the ones that will eventually be at the receiving end.</p><p>They stressed that Turji has been protecting them from other terrorists but they face an uncertain future with the military attacks.</p><p>Former media aide to Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers state, Oraye St. Franklin, has said that the crisis in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will be highly beneficial to Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi.</p><p>In a statement on Sunday, Franklin said that the PDP will go into its presidential campaigns deeply fractured which will ultimately strengthen the LP.</p><p>He argued that the crisis between Wike and the party’s flag bearer Atiku Abubakar has gone too deep and relations are now so strained that the differences are almost irreconcilable.</p><p>Supporting the call for Ayu’s resignation by his former principal, Franklin condemned Atiku for backing Ayy and refusing to honour the gentleman’s agreement in the party.</p><p>Speaking further, he said that Wike’s allegations against Ayu of fund mismanagement has compounded the whole situation as Nigerians have great mistrust for political leaders smeared with corruption and do not want to have anything to do with them.</p><p>The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will on Wednesday begin its presidential campaign nationwide with a solidarity march.</p><p>Naija News reports that the APC and other political parties will start their presidential campaigns nationwide on September 28 in line with the directive of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p><p>According to a statement released by the Tinubu Presidential Campaign Council, the solidarity march would start from the Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) office on Herbert Macaulay Way, Central Business District, Abuja, to the Unity Fountain, Maitama.</p><p>The statement added that necessary logistics had been put in place to ensure that the campaigns take off simultaneously in different regions of the country.</p><p>A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Joe Igbokwe, has said that the party has a poor reward system.</p><p>Igbokwe statement is coming after the release of APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) list for the 2023 general elections.</p><p>Naija News reports that the council list, which comprises about 400 members, was released on Friday by the PCC Secretary, James Faleke, a federal lawmaker.</p><p>Speaking after the list was released, Igbokwe insisted that the APC reward system is nothing to write home about as the party tends to reward persons of questionable characters.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.

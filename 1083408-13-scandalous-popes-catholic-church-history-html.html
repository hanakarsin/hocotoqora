Pope Stephen VI (896 to 897)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt4r1fmaul68u.jpeg><p class=align-left>This Pope set out to get revenge on his predecessor, Pope Formosus, who he felt had wronged him. He exhumed the nine-month-old corpse of predecessor and put it on trial. Formosus corpse was found guilty of perjury and his body was tossed into the Tiber River. Later, it was recovered and given a proper burial.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Rev Father undergoes 3 days dry fasting, gets flogged for hours (photos, video)</p><p class=align-left>Pope Stephen VI was later arrested, locked in a dungeon and strangled to death by supporters of Formosus.</p><p class=h2>2. Pope John XII (955 to 964)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6avaknmclcq.jpeg><p class=align-left>He attained the title of pope at age 18 and was said to have turned his residence into a brothel by committing adultery with numerous women, including two widows and his own niece, as well as his father's long-term girlfriend. He was also gambled with church offerings and was accused of even castrating a cardinal. He was reported to have died at the age of 20 when a jealous husband caught him in bed with his wife and beat him up mercilessly. The pope died three days later.</p><p class=h2>3. Pope Benedict IX (1032 and 1048)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt50dcd4r5e8m.jpeg><p class=align-left>He was a three-time pope and the nephew of both Pope John XIX and Pope Benedict VIII. He was not well liked and was described as "a demon from hell in the disguise of a priest." He reportedly stole, murdered and committed other, unspeakable deeds. He sold his holy title to his godfather for 1,500 pounds (680 kilograms) of gold.</p><p class=h2>4. Pope Boniface VIII (1294 - 1303)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1ach6v7qsq7.jpeg><p class=align-left>He said sleeping with boys was no more problematic than "rubbing one hand against the other." He erected statues of himself all over Rome and because of a personal political feud, the entire city of Palestrina was destroyed on his orders.</p><p class=h2>5. Pope Paul II (1464 - 1471)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt2emmkvuilb3.jpeg><p class=align-left>He was a nephew of Pope Eugenius IV (1431–1447). Accounts of his death vary. Some said he died of stroke while being sodomized by a page boy. Some others claimed he had collapsed from severe indigestion after eating melon in excess.</p><p class=h2>6. Pope Sixtus IV (1471 - 1484)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt612c1nkjuot.jpeg><p class=align-left>This pope had six illegitimate children, including one with his sister. He created a church tax on prostitutes and charged priests for having mistresses. He made six of his nephews cardinals.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Catholic priest seen with loaded rifle in Church</p><p class=h2>7. Pope Innocent VIII (1484 - 1492)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkytd6ttna7f7c8.jpeg><p class=align-left>He acknowledged having eight illegitimate children, though he may have had more. He encouraged and blessed the act of witch hunting.</p><p class=h2>8. Pope Alexander VI (1492 to 1503)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt76g8ifn1krc.jpeg><p class=align-left>He is one of the most memorable of the corrupt and secular popes. He bought his way into the papacy. His two dominant passions were love of women and greed of gold. He had a rollicking sex life and hosted an orgy in 1501 called the "Joust of Whores." He had several mistresses and fathered at least nine illegitimate children.</p><p class=h2>9. Pope Julius II (1503 to 1513)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6q0a6ak565i.jpeg><p class=align-left>He reportedly had several mistresses and at least one illegitimate daughter. Despite his sacred oath of celibacy, he contracted syphilis, apparently via prostitutes, and on Good Friday in 1508 his feet were so covered by sores that the faithful could not kiss them.</p><p class=h2>10. Pope Leo X (1513 to 1521)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt52i6h1skb6p.jpeg><p class=align-left>Leo X was very corrupt and allowed worshippers to buy their way into heaven. He had the habit of putting prices on others' sins and requiring them to give him money in return for absolving their wrongdoings. He threatened them that their souls would not be able to enter heaven if they didn't pay up. Upon his death, he left the papacy close to bankruptcy.</p><p class=h2>11. Pope Julius III (1550–1555)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt2udq2h5a3shg.jpeg><p class=align-left>He allegedly had a long love affair with Innocenzo Ciocchi del Monte, his adoptive nephew, which was a cause of public scandal. The Venetian ambassador at that time reported that Innocenzo shared the pope's bed.</p><p class=h2>12. Paul IV (1555 - 1559)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3kk0ui35ogt.jpeg><p class=align-left>He was unusually rigid and intolerant. Some of Rome's synagogues were destroyed under his reign. He was best known for his horrific acts of anti-Semitism. He created a Jewish ghetto in Rome, inside which Jews were obligated to identify themselves with a yellow head-covering. He was so hated that Paul IV was so hated that people ran through Rome and destroyed statues of him upon his death in 1559.</p><p class=h2>13. Pope Urban VIII (1623 t - 1644)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt34kkrivpumsg.jpeg><p class=align-left>He expanded the papal territory by force of arms and advantageous politicking. He practiced nepotism on a grand scale as he enormously enriched various members of his family. He incurred massive debts which greatly weakened his successors. During his reign, he was involved in a controversy with famed scientist Galileo and his theory on heliocentrism.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnGEkm1ncWVhaHq0r8Cnm5qkn6rAbrzOqZysZZOWwam7y6KaZpuYqr%2BktIyhoKysn6fGb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./2022-budget-buhari-speaks-on-borrowing-to-fund-capital-projects.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Buhari Speaks On Borrowing To Fund Capital Projects">&larr;

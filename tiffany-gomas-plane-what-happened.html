Titled Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, it follows Robert Wilson (William Shatner) as he embarks on his first flight after being released from a six-month stint at a sanitarium. He had a nervous breakdown during his last trip and is clearly worried about getting back on a plane. Things quickly take a turn for the worse when he spots "something on the wing of the plane," that no one else sees.</p><p>This gremlin ducks out of sight every time someone else goes to look. The episode ends with Robert being carried away in a straitjacket but as the plane is examined, the crew sees significant damage on the wing which means Robert was right all along.</p><p>In July 2023 a woman by the name of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiffany Gomas</a> was kicked off a flight after claiming someone on the plane wasn't real. Is life imitating art? What happened to Tiffany on that plane? Here's what we know.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Tiffany Gomas on that plane?</h2><p>In a viral <a href=#>TikTok</a> of the incident uploaded by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@knuckleslawncare</a>, Tiffany walks quickly up the aisle of an airplane screaming, "I'm telling you I'm getting the f--k off, and there's a reason why I'm getting the f--k off." That reason, according to Tiffany in the video, is there is someone on the plane who is "not real." She adds that people can stay on the plane and "die with him," but she wasn't going to.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The drama didn't end there as the 38-year-old marketing executive from Texas "allegedly tried multiple times to get back through airport security," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Business</a>. Despite getting her boarding pass revoked, it was still "active in the TSA system." Good thing we're all still removing our shoes, the real threat. No arrests were made, and Tiffany was seen outside exiting in an Uber.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"No one knows anyone else's story, and no one should judge. No one knows what it's like," said Tiffany to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a> in an exclusive interview conducted over a month after the incident. She didn't go into detail about what was going on that day, but she did reveal her life has been turned upside down since going viral. "They're staking out my house. They're staking out my neighbors. They're going through my mail," she told the outlet.</p><p>Apparently the argument started when Tiffany accused a relative she was traveling with of stealing her airpods. Still, this doesn't explain the incredibly creepy statements she made while exiting the plane. Perhaps Tiffany herself will have more to say on the matter.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tiffany Gomas is launching her own website.</h2><p>As the owner of a successful marketing company, it should surprise no one to learn that Tiffany is launching her own website. As of the time of this writing, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">self-named site</a> only has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two minute video from Tiffany</a> along with a cryptic "stay tuned," message. She calls herself the "crazy plane lady," but says that moniker is "completely warranted."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I have been unable to speak on the viral video, but I do finally feel that it's time," Tiffany says. She begins by taking responsibility for her actions which she deems "unacceptable." Her primary concern is the use of profanity but people are definitely more concerned about a phantom man who was going to kill everyone on the plane. That's the real issue.</p><p>Rightfully, Tiffany points out how invasive and unkind it is to become a meme as a result of a deeply upsetting moment in her life. She ends the video by sharing he hope to "use this experience and do a little bit of good in the world." Ultimately, her website will be devoted to "promoting positive mental health and standing up against cyberbullying."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbanssCnsGafn6KutHnPpZinnV2staLAjKGYqaiVo7Kl</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jayden-prasad-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jayden Prasad - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;

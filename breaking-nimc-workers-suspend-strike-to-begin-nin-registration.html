Some of us actually thought those guys were on leave. It was cleared yesterday (Wednesday) that they were treating themselves in isolation centres.”</p><p>The union accused the management of keeping silent about the development despite knowing what this could mean to workers of the commission.</p><p>Lucky said,&nbsp;“Our annoyance is that the management refused to say it out, knowing that it would have helped us to take all necessary precautions. Nobody is talking to anybody.”</p><p>“That is our annoyance. Yes, our pay is poor, but there are ways we can manage ourselves. The three staff members are in the headquarters here in Abuja. One has been treated, but has not gone back for clearance.”</p><p>He said the union had been making efforts to meet with the NIMC management over staff welfare but noted that the commission’s boss had not shown interest.</p><p>It was learnt that the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, tried to intervene in the matter, but could not, following disagreements on a suitable venue to hold a meeting.</p><p>Lucky said,&nbsp;“The minister came today, but we did not speak with him. When he came, we were outside and they asked us to come inside, but we refused because the management said yesterday (Wednesday) that the union chairman should go.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye49xZpuqlZa4qrrGZqWipZNixLC%2Byp6prGWjqsCxsc2dZKysop64pnnTqGSbnZeeu266yKdkq52XnsC1vsCtoKimXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rachel-hendrix-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rachel Hendrix - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;

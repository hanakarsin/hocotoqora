Daniel Sturridge</strong></p><p>Sensational striker who currently plays for Liverpool FC. He felt “deprived” when he did not have the opportunity to express himself at Chelsea under Jose Mourinho.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt687j430imvd.jpeg><p>Luck came his way when Brendan Rodgers pulled his £12million master stroke in the transfer market and paired Sturridge with Luis Suarez. That combination got over 50 goals at the 2013/2014 season.</p><p><strong>2. John Mikel Obi</strong></p><p>The Nigerian midfielder joined Chelsea in 2006, months after he was adjudged&nbsp;the second most valuable player at the u-20 World Cup.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Zinedine Zidane Replaces Rafael Benitez As Real Madrid Trainer</p><p>The 28-year-old was an attacking midfielder, but with manager Mourinho’s first spell at Stamford Bridge, Mikel played in the midfield alongside Joe Cole, Michael Essien, Frank Lampard, Michael Ballack, Malouda and few others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7n46t3aqhbp.jpeg><p>With time, he occupied the defensive midfield for Chelsea but showed great scoring potentials whenever he was on national duty, scoring a number of goals for the Super Eagles of Nigeria.</p><p>However, the return of ‘The Special One’ condemned the Nigerian to bench for most part of the 2014/2015 season at Chelsea.</p><p>With the sacking of Mourinho as Chelsea manager, interim coach, Guus Hiddink has rejuvenated Mikel’s game. With Chelsea’s 3 – 0 win away to Crystal Palace, Mikel was awarded the man of the match; an indication he is still a great player.</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;Juan Mata:</strong></p><p>Very skillful left-footer. The Spaniard won Chelsea’s Player of the Year in 2012 and 2013, playing a pivotal role for the Blues.</p><p>However, at a point, Mourinho condemned Mata to bench for an awful long time, an action which Chelsea fans considered "unfair".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt5qg58gjlm7c.jpeg><p>At his exit at Stamford Bridge, 'The Special One' apologised he did not make the Spainard “a better player”.</p><p>He said: <i>"I feel sorry that I didn't make him happy, but football is football and I build a team around Oscar in that position,"</i> Chelsea boss.</p><p>Mata moved to Manchester United and has since beaten his Chelsea goal tally in 22 fewer matches for the Red&nbsp;Devils.</p><p>The Spanish midfielder moved to Old Trafford in January 2014 for a hefty £37.1million and has made his mark at the Theatre of Dreams.</p><p><strong>4. Juan Cuadrado</strong></p><p>The Colombian star moved to Stamford Bridge for a reported £26 million with the hopes that his combination with Hazard will become a thorn in the flesh for defenders in England.</p><p>Yet, the former 'Blues' manager gave the former Fiorentina goal poacher little or no chance to showcase himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt2oc2ol3dvkd.jpeg><p>The 27-year-old attacking maestro who is currently on a season-long loan with Juventus scored 20 goals for Fiorentina before joining Chelsea.</p><p>However, under the ex Chelsea manager, Cuadrado only managed to appear 13 times in the 2014/2015 season with no goals; and&nbsp;in his new club Juventus, the Colombian has featured 14 times and has&nbsp;netted twice&nbsp;with the season just half way.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;WORLD RECORD: Manchester United Set To Sign Neymar</p><p><strong>5. Petr&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cech</strong></p><p>The Czech goalkeeper completed a £10m switch to the Gunners after the continual use of new arrival, Thibaut Courtois, as he was forced to the bench.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4ddh3pti326.jpeg><p>At his exit at Chelsea, Mourinho said:&nbsp;<i>“Petr Cech has been a great servant for Chelsea for 11 years and helped this club to win almost everything there is to win.”</i></p><p><i>“I always said I wanted him to stay but I understand Petr needed to move on to play first team football every week.</i></p><p>At Arsenal, Cech has been a major force that has helped Arsene Wenger’s men to the top of the EPL table after 20 games.&nbsp;&nbsp;[article_adwert]</p><p>The 33-year-old has featured for the Gunners in 20 games and has been crucial for the club, making quite a number of great saves.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3mBkmlvZm1dpbmixcSrqmain6iybrnOrqmippikeqK4zKiqrWWUmsC1vs6ynJ1lk5a%2FprHRZqehp6SkwG%2B006aj</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./army-releases-official-portrait-of-new-coas-lagbaja.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Army Releases Official Portrait Of New COAS, Lagbaja">&larr;

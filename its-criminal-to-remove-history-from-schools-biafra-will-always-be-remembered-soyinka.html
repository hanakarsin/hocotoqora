It is far more important and it is more dangerous because you can get trapped in it because it is collected as a community activity and some of that I think is happening to us here in Nigeria,” he said.</p><p>“I’m referring of course to Biafra.</p><p>“The collective memory there is very strong, even before the war, I warned that this collective memory might remain to plague efforts at nation being and that therefore, everything should be done to avoid that war.</p><p>“When I use expressions like, Biafra can never be defeated can never be wiped away, people thought I was talking about just the battlefield.</p><p>“I was talking about, a notion, a passion which enters the collective memory in active life not just as a past narrative. this is what I was warning against. And we’re seeing it today.</p><p>“Governments sometimes think that by undertaking the criminal act of removing history from schools, something which I never believed could ever happen to us. The government actually stopped teaching of history in schools.</p><p>“So naive, so stupid as not to recognise that there is something called memory, collective memory, active memory in the present.</p><p>“If the purpose was to obliterate the war or memories of the war, what about events that led up to the war? What about the position, the narrative of existence in relation to the outer world? How do you obliterate for heaven’s sake?</p><p>“Yet people sat down and went about their business when they removed history from the curriculum.</p><p>“That’s what I mean by saying that we must always adjudicate the present by history, by the collective memory.</p><h2>History Must Be Used In A Progressive Manner</h2><p>Soyinka however cautioned that history must not be allowed to become a negative tool but must be channeled in such a way as to create progressive mindsets.</p><p>“At the same time, however, we must take care not to become prisoners of that collective memory. That member must be able to use our collective memory in a progressive, productive, creative, and advanced way,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FqZqKso2Kws7XMoqWapF2pvG6%2BxKamr51dnba0wM6rsGaeoqS6br%2FCoaaopKNir6qtxauYZq%2BZoblurcuwmLKrXZeybr7EppymmpWnsqV50qiwoqablnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./narcos-mexico-ending-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mexico' Ending Explained How Does the Show End?

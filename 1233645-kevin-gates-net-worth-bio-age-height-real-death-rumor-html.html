Therefore, his birthday is nine days before Valentine’s Day.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/27d21de417f49348.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ryan Garcia: Facts about his boxing career, age, family, and net worth</span></p></a><h2>Kevin Gates age</h2><p class=align-left>Since Kevin Gates date of birth is February 5, 1986, from calculations, you will get to identify that as per 2019, he is 33 years old.

He was arrested at the age of 13 when he was caught “joyriding” as a passenger in a stolen vehicle. He was later released and got to attend the Baton Rouge Community College when he turned 17.

The three worked on his album called Pick of Da Litter which made the debut in 2007.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/417290c88fda3332.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Cody Fern: what is the American Horror Story star up to now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In the following year, he released another album entitled All or Nuthin’. In the album, he described some of his real-life experiences which he termed as very painful. Although his fans expected another album in the coming year, this was not the case.

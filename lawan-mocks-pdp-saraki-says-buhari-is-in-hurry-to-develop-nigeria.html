It is about Federal Government doing its own, working in partnership with the state government and even the local government and that is what we are doing.</p><p>“Every single project of Federal Government of Nigeria whether it is a constituency project or direct project from the Federal Government is to complement what the state government is doing and that partnership has been so purposeful that today in every corner, in every part of Nigeria, you have infrastructural development.</p><p>“The Federal Government of President Muhammadu Buhari is in a hurry. We are in a hurry to develop Nigeria.”</p><p>Lawan believed that by 2023, Nigeria would have been turned into an infrastructural laboratory due to ongoing projects in every part of Nigeria, from the east to the west to the north to the south.</p><p>He added: “In the east, the Second Niger Bridge, today it is at 75 to 80 per cent completion level. For 20 years, those people, they will go there, do groundbreaking and disappear to the ground. Another person would come, do groundbreaking and disappear to the ground.</p><p>“President Muhammadu Buhari did only one groundbreaking and today, it is at 75 per cent completion level. That is what it is, in every part of Nigeria.</p><p>“So the synergy between our states and the Federal government is working. It is making Nigeria to develop the infrastructure that we need. We have never seen it done like this one by this administration,” Lawan said.</p><p>Lawan also hailed the administration of Governor <strong>Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq</strong> for changing the narratives in Kwara state in terms of development and urged the people of Kwara State to consider him for another term to continue his good work.</p><p>He said: “APC administration in this state is barely two and half years but we know how far we have gone in two and half years.</p><p>Speaking about past governance in Kwara State, Lawan said that some persons were there for 16 years, but what Governor Abdulrazaq have been able to do in two and half years can be favourably compared with what those people have done in their 16 years of governance.</p><p>Naija News reports that former Senate President and Presidential aspirant, Sen. Bukola Saraki was a former Governor in Kwara State.</p><p>The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP chieftain served in the state as a Governor from 2003 to 2011.</p><p>Lawan, however, stressed that the citizens should not allow themselves to be deceived by making them believe Governor Abdulrazaq was not good enough.</p><p>He said: “No one should deceive you. No one should confuse you. Elect His Excellency, Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq for a second term. He has already performed so well in two and half years,” Lawan said.</p><p>He added that the Empowerment Programme of Senator Sadiq Suleiman Umar was to complement the efforts of the state government.</p><p>The Senate President went on to say that the people of Kwara had sent the best team to represent them at the Senate and appealed to them to continue to support the return bid of their three senators to the National Assembly.</p><p>He extolled the virtues of the Kwara North Senator for his commitment and dedication to work and for the quality representation of his people at the Senate.</p><p>The six Senators in company of the Senate President on the trip from Abuja were Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi( Senate Deputy Chief Whip), Bello Mandiya, Yakubu Oseni, Ibrahim Oloriegbe, Lola Ashiru and Smart Adeyemi.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49vZqWZp5a7brnOnKKsZaCZvW6%2FwKuYpKFdqK66v4ybrKGZop56qr%2BMoqVmoKWnv7p506hknZ2mmrmwvIynoKCdop6ucA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./top-nigerian-newspaper-headlines-for-today-saturday-19th-february-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top Nigerian Newspaper Headlines For Today, Saturday, 19th February, 2022">&larr;

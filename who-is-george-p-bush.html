Bush</a> is the first member of the Bush family to endorse Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential race. The Commissioner of the Texas General Land Office expressed his support for the president via a statement published by the Texas Tribune and the Dallas Morning News on Tuesday, June 9.&nbsp;</p><p>The politician garnered applause for his progressive position on race, and for his efforts to create more political opportunities for the members of the Hispanic community in particular. So, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who is he</a>?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is George. P. Bush?</h2><p>George P. announced that he intended to vote for Donald Trump in the 2020 election via a statement published by the Texas Tribune and the Dallas Morning News.&nbsp;</p><p>"President Trump is the only thing standing between America and socialism," the Commissioner of the Texas General Land Office argued.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The announcement came as a surprise to some of his supporters. George P. earned popularity with campaigns championing racial diversity, educational reforms, and veteran rights. In the past, he also spoke about the importance of renovating Alamo and protecting the Gulf Coast from future disasters.&nbsp;</p><p>"@georgepbush wants to have his cake and eat it too. Wants to seem progressive on race while supporting the racist-in-chief @realDonaldTrump You're just a two-faced hypocrite just like your dad and uncle #Minneapolisprotests #MAGAt," a person opined on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>"just found out there’s a “George P. Bush” and it’s like when a JRPG villain somehow comes back for like the fourth time," tweeted another person.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Some turned out to be much more sympathetic.&nbsp;</p><p>"George P. Bush says he will vote for President Trump. Thank God at least one Bush family member has some common sense," tweeted someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>George P. announced his intention to run for Commissioner of the Texas General Land Office in 2012. He won the 2014 elections, and he successfully scored the majority of the Hispanic vote. He was re-elected in 2018.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>As a member of the Bush family, George P. played a crucial role in the political discussions taking place in and around Texas from an unusually early age. He gave one of his first speeches at the age of 12, speaking in front of the 1988 Republican National Convention that nominated his grandfather, George W. H. Bush.&nbsp;</p><p>The prominent family counts highly influential politicians, businessmen, and TV personalities among its members. George P. &nbsp;&nbsp;refers to his late grandfather and the 41st President of the U.S. as "Gampy."&nbsp;</p><p>His father, Jeb Bush, served as the 43rd Governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007. He also ran in the 2016 presidential race. He dropped out after losing out to Donald Trump in the South Carolina primary on February 20, 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>George P. didn't cast his vote on his father in the 2016 elections. He sided with Donald Trump, the candidate who would mockingly call his father "low energy Jeb," instead.&nbsp;</p><p>On April 10, 2019, President Trump introduced him as "the only Bush that likes me," during a visit to Crosby, Tex.&nbsp;</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. endorsed George P. Bush's during the 2018 election for the Commissioner role at the Texas General Land Office. However, he had to pull out from a fundraiser in June that year, due to a clash between President Trump and former Governor Bush.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKCdn6e0pnnPZpmuq5g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./barrett-foa-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Barrett Foa - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;

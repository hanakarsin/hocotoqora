Zari and Ivan were married for approximately twelve years, and together they have three handsome boys named Pinto, Raphael Junior, and Quincy pictured below.</p><h3>Who is Zari ex husband?</h3><p class=align-left>Ivan Ssemwanga was a renowned Ugandan entrepreneur, socialite, and philanthropist. He was one of the Rich Gang group members that is famous in South Africa and Uganda. The group was mainly involved in charity work that targeted the less privileged Ugandan youths living in South Africa. Additionally, Ivan had heavily invested in numerous educational institutions in South Africa that Zari manages to date. Here are Zari Hassan ex husband photos obtained from the late Ivan’s Instagram:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/99e63350188fb211.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The tea on all the men Zari Hassan has dated</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Zari remained Ivan’s first love, and he was in love with her until his last breath. Zari confessed that Ivan was the best man she ever met and never wanted to dump him. What most of you did not know is the two married in a simple traditional wedding ceremony held in Uganda. Below we reveal one of the photos taken during Zari and Ivan’s wedding day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8c4060889720fa0a.jpeg><h3>Why Zari left Ivan</h3><p class=align-left>Zari Hassan divorced Ivan back in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2013</a>. When two known celebrities part ways, most people believe that it is the woman’s fault. Zari’s case was no different and many bashed her for leaving Ivan then coming back to fight for his wealth after he died. However, after much speculations, Zari finally opened up and exposed that Ivan was obsessed with her to the point that he got physical and would hit her in front of their three sons. According to Zari, leaving Ivan was no easy task as she had sired three kids with him and built an empire too. Zari explained that she tried working on the relationship and even booked counseling sessions for Ivan who ended up not showing for the sessions but would pay the counselor to say that he attended. Efforts to have the elders and family intervene on the matter was also futile leaving Zari to make the difficult decision of leaving her marriage.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs27a2q6gh833g.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Zari Hassan's children: How many kids does she have?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Zari explained that even after leaving Ivan, she forgave him, and with time the two maintained a relationship as co-parents and friends.</p><h3>Zari Hassan ex husband dead</h3><p class=align-left>Due to a massive stroke, Ivan Ssemwanga was admitted to Steve Biko Academic Hospital slipping into a coma, and he later died on the morning of 25th May 2017. His body returned to Uganda where he was laid to rest. Even though Zari and Ivan were no longer together, and she was married to bongo star Diamond, Zari remained at Ivan's bedside throughout the entire time in hospital until his demise.</p><h2>Zari Hassan and Diamond</h2><p class=align-left>Sometime back in 2014, Zari and Diamond began dating, and their relationship has emerged to be one of the most talked about unions in the continent. Diamond Platinumz (real names Naseeb Abdul Juma) is a renowned recording artist in Tanzania whose fame transverse East Africa to other continents. The relationship between Zari and Diamond had so many ups and downs as least expected. According to the two, their relationship began when Zari <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DMed</a> Diamond on twitter asking him to grace her all-white party. Diamond brushed her off thinking that she was a groupie and he let her know that she needed to speak with his manager for any bookings. Later, it came to Diamond’s knowledge that Zari was an established brand and not a groupie as he presumed. Within no time, the two met during a flight and exchanged numbers, and the rest, as they say, is history. Here are photos of Zari and Diamond together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs7aovcq66qoc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Zari Hassan biography - Who is Zari the Boss Lady?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When Diamond and Zari decided to let the world know that they were together, they met severe backlash. First because Diamond was still dating Wema Sepetu, a Tanzanian sweetheart who is an actress and former Miss Tanzania. The announcement was how Wema knew that she had been dumped resulting in #teamwema #teamzari and #teamdiamond rivalry on all social media platforms. Additionally, other fans felt that Zari Hassan was not the best choice for Diamond as Dee is younger than Zari by nine years. However, despite all the hate going on, the two remained together and announced that they were pregnant expecting their first baby together. On August 2015, Zari and Diamond announced the birth of their baby Latiffah Dangote. Several months later after Tiffa’s birth, it was revealed that Zari was expecting the second born and many fans thought it was too soon. Diamond responded that they wanted to have children early so that they could enjoy their time together and watch their kids grow. Zari and Diamond got their son Nilan Dangote on the 5th December 2016.</p><p class=align-left>Here are photos of Tiffa and Nilan with their parents:</p><h2>Why Zari left Diamond</h2><p class=align-left>On Valentine’s Day, Zari announced that she was leaving her second husband, Naseeb Abdul Juma, through a post of a black rose and beneath it was a long caption explaining why she had to come to that decision. Here is that picture from Zari Hassan Instagram page.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: 10 facts about Zari the Boss Lady, Diamond Platnumz wife, you didn't know</strong></p><p class=align-left>The sassy socialite revealed that the reason for divorcing Diamond was due to his numerous cases of infidelity. She further explained that she would maintain joint custody of the two children with Diamond. Later on, in an interview with British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Zari Hassan revealed that she was capable of taking care of her kids and was not expecting any child support from her ex-husband Diamond Platinumz. At first, fans speculated that Zari and Diamond would get back together as they had done countless times in the past, but to our surprise, I think that this is the end of the road for the two as a couple.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li>Who is Gloria Muliro husband?</li><li>Who is Linda Ogutu husband?</li><li>Truth about Lilian Muli husband</li><li>Amina Abdi husband.

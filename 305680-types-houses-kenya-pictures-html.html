Of particular interest are the numerous residential units that have dotted the country that continue to increase each day significantly. Numerous factors have contributed to the current development, but we can keep the topic for another day. At the moment, it will be appropriate to focus on the different types of houses in Kenya.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/8887f8cc34202366.jpeg><p class=align-left>It is very easy to loosely term houses in Kenya as this or that even without paying much attention to the style, scale, or even the spatial arrangement. The parameters should ideally determine what type a house is. In different parts of the world, people have adopted style as the defining factor on the various house categories. This is the greatest determinant in defining the following types of houses with pictures and definitions.</p><h2>What are the different types of houses in Kenya?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/163b08d551ccbcd2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 most conservative countries in the world in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As you look at the different variations of houses, it is essential to bear in mind that most Kenyan architecture in the towns and cities borrow their inspiration from European countries. That is why the terminologies used and styles mentioned will seem to reflect those of the region. Just like in Europe, brick and mortar are Kenya’s most popular building components. While it may be true that this list may not be as exhaustive with several points of departure as a result of the parameters used, this content represents the general scenario on the ground. So what are different kinds of houses?</p><h3>Contemporary homes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/163b08d551ccbcd2.jpeg><p class=align-left>This specifically refers to a wide range of houses that were designed by architects and built in recent decades. The homes in this category place their emphasis on simple designs and geometric lines. Contemporary homes succeeded the international style, and this reflects just how dynamic and experimental the post-colonialism generation of builders was. This resulted in a period that saw the integration of great modernist ideas from Europe and western countries.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/33579f468953d79e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best African countries to live and work in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Generally, contemporary homes are those you would find in the countryside. Just like most of our grandfathers’ houses, the house design features plenty of open floor plans, lots of glass windows, and incredibly inventive designs. Also, the exteriors of homes in the contemporary category come from dynamic textures and materials. This is aimed at avoiding unnecessary detail as well as elaborate ornamentation.</p><h2>Mansionette homes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/b80f17002df25aeb.jpeg><p class=align-left>A mansion goes beyond being just a residence – it is also a symbol. Size may not be significant, and the answer depends on who you ask. There are realtors who may perceive houses measuring 5,000 square feet to qualify as a mansion, while others believe that a mansion must measure at least 8,000 square feet. In affluent sections of the different cities in the country, only homes measuring over 20,000 feet can qualify.</p><p class=align-left>Different members of the political class are known to own these majestic homes. For instance, the former prime minister Raila Odinga has one beautiful home located near the Kisumu International Airport. The house has ten bedrooms, a humongous helipad, jacuzzis, a theatre, state of the art kitchens, and conference halls.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0cff054b8cff0718.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Container houses in Kenya: A complete guide</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another public figure known to have such a massive property is Vice President William Ruto.</p><h3>Mabati houses</h3><p class=align-left>Most may have the perception that when a person lives in a fabricated house, then it means that there are struggling financially. However, mabati house ideas can create incredible permanent homes. A well-built mabati house will leave your neighbors and friends wishing to include the idea in their plans. Before beginning any construction work, it is ideal that you have an estimate of the cash that would be sufficient for the entire project.</p><p class=align-left>The best way to create an estimate is to seek inspiration from anyone else with a similar style. Also, you can read this article on Mabati houses in Kenya to know what is required of you to come up with a unique design.</p><h3>Apartment houses in Kenya</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/33579f468953d79e.jpeg><p class=align-left>By definition, an apartment may be a single unit in one big building that a family or person can use as a dwelling place. An apartment can be occupied by either a tenant or owner. In this country, the word ‘flat’ is always used as a synonym of the same, but other markets consider it to be one of lesser quality. That is why in Kenya, you will never hear that someone resides in an apartment in Eastlands or a flat in Lavington.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9fc6af29b8c6e4b5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 20 least marketable courses in Kenya in 2024 (updated)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The growth of these housing units has been rapid yet steady, especially in upmarket areas such as Kileleshwa, Lavington, Kilimani, etc. where mansions have been removed to give way for this development. The houses may range from one up to four bedrooms, and some come with servants’ quarters. Developers add salient features such as swimming pools, clubhouses, ponds, and much more. Their appeal lies in their amenities, size, style, and number of units, but the price is usually the real determinant. Mostly, these residences are occupied by upper-middle-income earners. With the recent upsurge in the number of these housing units, the number of middle-income earners has grown significantly.</p><h3>Earth houses</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/5a3405244793b7eb.jpeg><p class=align-left>What is more friendly to the earth itself than an earth house? Houses created from the soil beneath our feet are the ideal example of what sustainable construction should look like. Interestingly, the longest standing buildings on the planet are earthen. So next time you see those mud-walled hoses in the countryside, just know someone out there is doing the environment a favor.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/921b55d0ba5d0e67.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 best cars in the world 2022: Mind-blowing ranking</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is a common method of building, and some even go further to plaster the walls with concrete such that you would not even notice that the house is made of mud. The use of a particular mix of clay as well as the use of earthbags and cob houses are a modern twist to what was originally used.</p><h3>Condominiums (condo) in Kenya</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0cff054b8cff0718.jpeg><p class=align-left>Used as a short form of the word Condominium, these are living spaces quite similar to apartments. The only difference is that these can be sold independently and therefore are treated as real estate. One great example of such a building is the Eighty Eight Nairobi Condominium that is currently under construction in Upper Hill. The capital city is also home to several other similar residences such as the Heri Heights Serviced Apartments, Exeter Rose Apartments, The Ridge by Cytonn Real Estate, Nairobi Gamepark Apartments, and Chalbi Condominiums.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs26odu1bnscng.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Types of marriages in Kenya recognized by law</span></p></a><h3>Town House</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0e77b50647b308e7.jpeg><p class=align-left>This term was used in the pre-World War I era to refer to a huge house owned by aristocrats and located in the city. But here in Kenya, we use this term to refer to something slightly different. Generally, you will find the houses mostly in the upmarket areas – particularly in gated compounds. There may be two or three levels, including a plinth area measuring approximately 250-400 square meters.</p><p class=align-left>Just like apartments, the common areas and facilities here are shared, but they offer more operational codes and exclusive features that make the communities seem like clubs with private members. These residences boast salient features like clubhouses, swimming pools, basketball courts, tennis courts, boreholes, gyms, landscaped gardens, etc. Notably, these residences are usually under the protection of private security firms as well as the Kenya police.</p><h3>Container homes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9fc6af29b8c6e4b5.jpeg><p class=align-left>These type of houses are majorly created from shipping containers. Thanks to creative Kenyan designers, there are different ways that you can transform this transportation asset and turn it into a comfortable living space at a significantly lower budget. It will take a little addition to the interior or exterior, and you will have yourself a functional home that can have as much as three bedrooms.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs2en1gvu9hhkg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Looking forward to build a dream house in Kenya? Get this free copies of house plans</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Not only is this type of house secure, but it is also easy to set up and affordable as well. Also, it is among the few house varieties that can be moved from one location to the other without much hassle. This cool idea came as a surprise since containers have been in the county for quite some time now. But the latest innovations in designs and building creativity has greatly diversified the way people transform containers into great modern living spaces.</p><h3>British/European rustic designs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/ab98281eceec11d3.jpeg><p class=align-left>This architectural design has deep roots in the pre-colonial era and was popularized by the British settlers who brought along with them their sensibilities accompanied by their home design ideas.</p><p class=align-left>Another great example is Njoro’s Lord Egerton Castle, which stands at a driving distance of 30 minutes from Nakuru town. With its British-inspired design, the fascinating architecture stands within canopy trees, lush lawns, and numerous shrubs. It was built by Lord Egerton himself from 1938 to 1952.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1ovvudkcejoo.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>There are beautiful Kenyan house plans photos one can choose from when building there home</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Another great example is the Karen Blixen house in Nairobi</p><h3>African architecture</h3><p class=align-left>The country has not only relied on foreign inspiration to come up with the vast architectural creations, and there are many modern house designs that still keep the African heritage. This is most evident in the roofing used, flooring, and shapes of houses. From the mud and grass thatched houses of western Kenya to the limestone and makuti houses of the Coast, it is evident that culture cannot be easily eroded from the minds of Kenyans.</p><p class=align-left>One of the most popular modern designs that borrow some African inspiration is the Tiwi Beach Hotel in Mombasa.</p><p class=align-left>Just like in different parts of the world, style has been quite significant in shaping the local residential property market. Indeed, nothing still remains out of reach as far as home varieties are concerned. Which among the types of houses do you fancy?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1bljaq0qsop8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cool simple house plans in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:</p><ul><li>Features and symbolism of Swahili architecture</li><li>3 bedroom house plans & designs in Kenya</li><li>Best architects in Kenya - list of architectural firms in Kenya</li><li>Architect who designed iconic KICC building says it was to look like donkey’s penis</li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Fj25tcWhdqcaxsdJmn6ito5rAbrfEp7CaZaCesLXB0Z6qZ6Ckork%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./even-policemen-fled-says-resident-as-gunmen-attack-travellers-in-rivers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Even Policemen Fled, Says Resident As Gunmen Attack Travellers In Rivers">&larr;

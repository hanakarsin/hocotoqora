We get invested in their lives, or what little the stars share on social media and through other platforms. For <a href=#>Christina Anstead</a>, she recently announced she was getting a divorce from her second husband, Ant Anstead.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the two only got married a short while ago, fans want to know why are Christina and Ant getting a divorce? And like most things, it's complicated.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why are Christina and Ant Anstead getting a divorce?</h2><p>On Sept. 19, 2020, Christina posted a photo to Instagram of herself and her husband of less than two years walking on a beach. The caption shared that the two had decided to make a difficult decision and separate.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Ant and I have made the difficult decision to separate.

"We are grateful for each other and as always, our children will remain our priority. We appreciate your support and ask for privacy for us and our family as we navigate the future." She had turned off the comments on that post, so her fans were not able to ask questions, but it was clearly a shock to many.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, rumors started circulating that it was Christina that left Ant, but as more sources spoke about the split, it seems the two had just grown apart. More so after the birth of their son, Hudson, they appeared to become distant. They announced their split just a few weeks after he celebrated his first birthday.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Happy 1Ô∏è‚É£ Birthday Hudson!

I‚Äôm hearing that Christina and Ant just grew apart," a source said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life & Style</a>. "They‚Äôre very different people from totally different backgrounds, and that definitely played a factor. Friends say Ant was the first one who started having feelings about splitting."</p><p>On Sept. 26, 2020, Ant took to social media to clear the air, subtly, and basically said that the decision to split wasn't his. "Anyone who really knows me knows that I don‚Äôt like to share private matters publicly," he posted along with a black and white photo of himself and Christina. "I have remained silent while holding on to hope. I never gave up on us. I pray Christina‚Äôs decision brings her happiness."</p><p>Neither have, at this time, shared exactly what the reason or reasons were for the split, but Christina did address the assumptions.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Christina Anstead hit back at the people judging her for having a second divorce.</h2><p>Also, on the same day that Ant spoke about the divorce, on Sept. 26, 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina posted to social media</a> about the people judging her for having another divorce on the way.&nbsp;</p><p>"For those of you who don‚Äôt know me (or think you know me) let me reintroduce myself," she started the post. "I hate crowds, I love traveling, all things spiritual, the ocean and deep one on one conversations. I never thought about being on tv. I wanted to be a sports agent like Jerry Maguire. But I always loved looking at houses with my parents especially model homes and I always wanted to be my own boss."</p><p>She wrote more about how she ended up flipping houses and getting on TV and then discussed her personal life. "I never thought I would have one divorce let alone two," she wrote. "I never thought I would have 2 baby daddies - but sometimes life throws us curve balls. Instead of getting stuck in these 'setbacks' I choose to look at these challenges as opportunities to grow. So while some may judge me and throw around rumors about me, most of you support me."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>For those of you who don‚Äôt know me (or think you know me) let me reintroduce myself.

But I always loved looking at houses with my parents especially model homes and I always wanted to be my own boss... So in college when I was called (intuitively) to get my real estate license at a local community college I followed my intuition. I got started in real estate at 21 which led to selling houses which led to flipping houses which led to Tv. Now while I never wanted to be on tv, stepping out of my comfort zone and into the unknown has always been my thing. I live in a state of anxiousness and I‚Äôm so used to it that when it‚Äôs not there I tend to feel a void and hop into something that causes the feeling I‚Äôm used to. This can be good and bad. And it‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôm working on breaking the pattern of. Sometimes anxiety and pursuit of new dreams leads me down amazing paths, other times it leaves me feeling lost and in a state of fight or flight / or crying in my closet. Tv changed my life and I am grateful for the life it‚Äôs provided, the experiences, the friends I‚Äôve made along the way. Sometimes our calling is bigger than our plans. I never thought I would have one divorce let alone two. I never thought I would have 2 baby daddies - but sometimes life throws us curve balls. Instead of getting stuck in these ‚Äúsetbacks‚Äù I choose to look at these challenges as opportunities to grow. So while some may judge me and throw around rumors about me, most of you support me. And that says a lot about this world and where we are headed. I‚Äôm messy, I‚Äôm real and I‚Äôm working on healing. I‚Äôm surrounded by extremely powerful women who help me cope, build me up and push me to be better. If you‚Äôve DM me or text me - I haven‚Äôt written back because I‚Äôm taking time to clear the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù and focus on myself and the kids. I appreciate the support and I hope my story inspires you to not be so hard on yourself for the decisions / choices you‚Äôve made. We are all a work in progress. ‚ú®‚ô•Ô∏è</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Christina Anstead</a> (@christinaanstead) on Sep 26, 2020 at 8:05am PDT</p></figure><p>"I‚Äôm messy, I‚Äôm real and I‚Äôm working on healing.

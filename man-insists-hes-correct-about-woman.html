There's really no need for a man to offer his <a href=#>unsolicited opinion</a> on something that has absolutely nothing to do with him, yet many still do it — and it's annoying AF.</p><p>On Aug. 9, 2023, <a href=#>TikTok</a> user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@alexandloveland</a> posted a video and shared that one of her male co-workers insisted that he knew more about her makeup routine than she did. OK, seriously dude?</p><p>Read on for the whole story. Plus, stick around to hear what social media has to say about this guy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This man insists he's correct about how much makeup his female co-worker wears to work.</h2><p>"It baffles me how little men will know about a topic, yet still speak on it with conviction," the TikToker began before delving into the infuriating interaction she recently had with a male co-worker at work.</p><p>"Today at work, one of my male co-workers comes up to me, and he goes, 'You're wearing more makeup today than you were yesterday.'" OK, two things:</p><li>It's none of his business how much makeup she wears to work.</li><li>Why did he feel the need to comment on his female co-worker's appearance?</li><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@alexandloveland href=#>@alexandloveland</a><p>I literally cant form words after a night shift. Goodnight yall</p><a title="♬ original sound - user774045" href=#>♬ original sound - user774045</a></figure><p>Anyways, the TikTok creator said she wasn't wearing more makeup, revealing that the day before, she "had a whole beat ... I had concealer, bronzer, everything on. And today, I only wore a little bit of tinted moisturizer, [which is] the least amount of makeup I've ever worn to work in an entire year."</p><p>The two went back and forth for a while, with the TikToker eventually telling her co-worker, "Yesterday I had like eight or night products on my face, and today I only have two.'"</p><p>"And he goes, 'No, it's definitely more makeup today,'" she recalled. Ugh — will this guy ever just give up?!</p><p>In the end, the TikToker exclaimed, "I know what I put on my face!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">TikTok couldn't believe the audacity of this woman's co-worker.</h2><p>The now-viral video has more than 431,000 views and over 1,200 comments from fellow TikTokers wondering how this woman's makeup routine has anything to do with her male co-worker.</p><p>"OMG," reads the top comment. "And like, how does that even matter to him AT ALL?!"</p><p>A second person wrote, "That sounds so frustrating, OMG," while a third TikTok user added, "I would have asked him to name all the products used today if he knew what I put on better than I do."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @cowlov3rr</span></figure><p>Others shared similar experiences: "My brother once argued with his wife over some fact about eyes," a TikTok shared, adding, "She's an optometrist. He is not."</p><p>"My brother-in-law tried to mansplain builder gel to me," another person revealed. "I'm a part-time nail tech in a STEM major. He works at a gas station…"</p><p>A third TikToker responded, "My dad once argued that I didn't wear a Size 9 women's shoe cause women's shoes don't even come in size 9." OK, has this man ever been in a shoe store before?!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @fiftyshadesofnah</span></figure><p>Someone else commented, "The way I was talking about how painful period cramps are with my female coworker and my MALE coworker just says, 'They can't be that bad.'" Ugh — we despise this.</p><p>If you've ever fallen victim to mansplaining, let us know, because we have plenty more stories to tell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6vecinqqKrpKh6qbHSZpqoqqKasLV5wJumrqxdrLyurc0%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tahir-whitehead-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tahir Whitehead - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;

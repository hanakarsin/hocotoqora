For true stories, Kenyans have exceptionally excellent talent at spinning these truths out of proportion. Unfortunately, most of the people on the receiving end are often celebrities and prominent people. After all, they say that all publicity is good publicity. Here are some of the stories that have gone too far yet no one can ascertain the truth in them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/0fgjhs3da1iaq3fd1g.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Who is Billy Graham? 5 things you should know about him!</strong></p><h2><strong>Hot Kenyan gossip 2017</strong></h2><h3><strong>Wawa is cheating</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Rumors emerged when Dagoretti south parliamentary aspirant in the 2017 elections was found fondling an unidentified woman’s thighs. The staunch supporter of Jubilee and its candidates was in trouble when photos of his extra activities leaked. The aspirant was quick to respond by saying that the leaked photos were a plan of political rivals and probably ex-girlfriends who were out to tarnish his name, but no truth existed in such claims. For him, the woman was nothing more than a good friend of his.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9660db5c92a1707c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyans Share Lessons They Have Learnt in Marriages, Relationships: "Marry Your Best Friend"</span></p></a><h3><strong>MC Jessy to Divorce wife of six years for Shix Kapyenga</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Jessy and Shix have always been fond of each other. It is unfortunate that their closeness became a hot Kenyan celeb gossip especially when the two were seen in Dubai together celebrating Shix birthday. Kenyans were quick to start spreading hot Kenyan gossip news of how Jessy was leaving his wife of 6 years, Elizabeth Wangare, due to cases of infidelity. No one has come forth to verify any such info which means that it could be a fabrication of some very imaginative Kenyans, at least until proven otherwise.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Hawa ndio watu 9 nchini Kenya wanaomiliki magari ya bei ghali zaidi?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9660db5c92a1707c.jpeg><h2><strong>Hot Kenyan gossip 2016</strong></h2><h3><strong>Eunice Njeri Cheats</strong></h3><p class=align-left>A lot came up when Eunice Njeri left her husband on their wedding night after a colorful wedding ceremony that took place in the US. Upon confirmation of the divorce Kenyans had a lot to say with some claiming that Njeri was a cheat. The accusations came from every quarter with few taking the time to understand what could have happened. Njeri seemed to be on the receiving end when her ex-husband Busaka appeared loving all the way even after she opted out of the marriage. He still considered her the best thing to ever happen to him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7b8720de36bac135.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Video of Heartbroken Man Weeping Over Death of His Wife at Hospital Evokes Painful Emotions</span></p></a><h2><strong>Hot Kenyan celebrity gossip</strong></h2><h3><strong>Avril is a lesbian</strong></h3><p class=align-left>For a while this was the news that took the internet by storm. While it is understood where the rumors came from as photos of her in bed with another woman leaked, no one can say for sure that the two were lesbians. This is even more unbelievable since Avril is soon going down the aisle with her South African love. That for sure does not seem like a lesbian for you. Or does it?</p><h3><strong>Octopizzo joins illuminati</strong></h3><p class=align-left>It is almost ordinary for Kenyans to sources for hot Kenyan gossip at the expense of other people’s reputation. They especially love to downplay the hard work of artists and individuals whose hard work appears to be paying off. Octopizzo happened to feel the brunt of this one time when propaganda was spread about his membership in the cult illuminati just because the hard working and legit rapper was excelling and some people could not explain it. While it is true that some artists use videoo to try forge ahead, it makes no sense to categorize everyone especially if their hard work is clearly evident. Results will definitely come, no forces needed to push for it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e8c642deaec8ed37.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Former TPF Star Alvan Love Says He's Always Falling for Wrong Women, Can't Find Mrs. Right</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs6905v2j1e28.jpeg><h3><strong>Lilian Muli and Mike Sonko are dating</strong></h3><p class=align-left>This is one of those rumors that shows how Kenyans are either idle or have the bad habit of putting their noses where they are not needed. Claims of Sonko and Muli dating came up because some twisted Kenyan decided that their taking a photo together has to be something more. Unfortunately, fans help spread such untrue rumors sometimes unknowingly when they turn to bash their icon without verifying the sources of the info.</p><h3><strong>Huddah Monroe Pregnant and awaiting marriage</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Huddah is one of the celebrities that know too well what rumors in Kenya are. A few years back she was forced onto a Ghanaian tycoon and prophesied to be married due to her alleged pregnancy. Five years have gone, and we are yet to see a married Huddah or better yet a mother in the socialite. If you are any wise, you would be careful about accepting any info that comes your way n matter how juicy it seems. You do not want to be a culprit of latest hot Kenyan gossip and fall into the trap of expert story weavers. This is not the first time news of her pregnant have circulated the web.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/044f7feabeb73b8f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Women Heartbroken After Jakakimba's Wedding: "I Can't Breathe"</span></p></a><h3><strong>Nyota Ndogo dead</strong></h3><p class=align-left>One area Kenya hot gossip news has crossed the line is where celebrities have been killed even when they are very alive. It beats one to understand what gets into the heads of such people to bring pain and fear to family and friends of the said deceased individual. Nyota Ndogo fell culprit to such rumors, yet at the time of the rumor she was healthy and performing at the sawasawa festival in Nairobi. She was shocked when Ali Manzu called her to express concern of what he had read on Facebook about her death. Kenyans should rethink such acts; it is no longer funny.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7b8720de36bac135.jpeg><h3><strong>Moses Kuria Orders Mungiki man to Kill Raila</strong></h3><p class=align-left>Like all rumors, Kenyans love to create those that will likely catch the attention of others. It is as if the starters of such stories thrive through controversies. No one can ascertain any of these claims which leaves them as rumors. After all, Raila still lives.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8d4cc67028c3c3fa.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Female Politician Urges Husband Snatchers Not to Complain but Prove Themselves as the Best Wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: William Ruto sounds tough warning to school heads demanding fees from day- scholars</strong></p><h3><strong>Mama Idah Divorces Baba</strong></h3><p class=align-left>This one was also one targeting a politician with a huge following. Just because she did not show up someone decided to come up with theories to explain her absence without any truthful verifications to mama Idah and Raila's state of affairs. There could be a thousand and one reasons why things happened as they did.</p><p class=align-left>Kenyans would be better advised to desist from the habit of overthinking and idly coming up with rumors. Sometimes this false information can be fatal as certain people would act on them without better advice. Read a book, visit a friend or go for a swim if you have to. Rumors do more harm than good even though no one sees it out rightly. It is even worse with social media.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BlXBncXBdqbKveceoq2ajlaPGorqMoKasq5mleqet0WefraWc</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./just-in-cso-begins-protest-in-edo-over-economic-hardship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CSO Begins Protest In Edo Over Economic Hardship">&larr;

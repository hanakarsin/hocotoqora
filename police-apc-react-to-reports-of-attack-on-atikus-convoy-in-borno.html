Babagana Zulum took over the mantle of leadership, he banned all forms of thuggery in the state.</p><p>“Our ruling party is a law-abiding political party, and that is why we as government did not deny PDP a venue for its rally as experienced in some states.</p><p>“All I know is that there is no PDP in Borno, and if Melaye lacks what to tell the people of Borno to get their votes, he should desist from fabricating lies against our party,’’ Dalori said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49yZqmnnJ6wpnnAqZpmqpWWsLV506hkq52gpL%2B1v4yonWaZpKmupLeMqKVmmaSeuLa%2FjJymp66frnqquoybpqumn2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rhys-gannon-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rhys Gannon - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;

Not even the civilized world expected such monumental corruption in the conduct of security matters. This criminality in the nation’s law enforcement makes a child’s play of the scandalous reinstatement of pension funds thief, Abdulrasheed Maina. Just when Nigerians thought they have seen it all, they never suspected that a supposed super cop was a super crook neck-deep in the trafficking of hard drugs and well versed in its dealership.</p><p>The&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC)&nbsp;primary Committee has met with the three major aspirants contesting for the party’s ticket ahead of the Osun governorship election.</p><p>The committee chaired by Kwara Governor AbdulRahman Abdulrazak on Friday met with Governor Gboyega Oyetola, Moshood Adeoti and Lasun Yusuf at the party’s secretariat in Osogbo, the state capital.</p><p>It was gathered that Adeoti arrived at the meeting around 6:15pm, while the Ex-Deputy Speaker of House of Representatives Lasun Yusuf came in around 6:19pm.</p><p>The main opposition&nbsp;Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)&nbsp;is still a long way from settling differences associated with the zoning of its presidential ticket ahead of the 2023 elections.</p><p>It was gathered that in a bid to find a solution to the zoning brouhaha, PDP governors had embarked on an unsuccessful trip to neighbouring Ghana.</p><p>The retreat in Ghana which was initiated to end the disagreement over the zoning failed to yield desired results as warring parties refused to sheath their swords.</p><p>President&nbsp;Muhammadu Buhari&nbsp;will forever be remembered by Nigerians for constructing important projects that are vital to the economic development of the country, the Presidency has said.</p><p>Presidential Spokesman,&nbsp;Femi Adesina&nbsp;stated that his principal will not be forgotten for the construction of some projects such as the Second Niger Bridge which will be completed this year.</p><p>He made the submission in an article titled, ‘NDABOSKI! If Only For 2nd Niger Bridge, This Country Won’t Ever Forget Buhari’ released on his Facebook page on Friday.</p><p>The&nbsp;National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA)&nbsp;has reportedly tightened security at its headquarters at Gambia, Area11, Garki, Abuja.</p><p>It was gathered that the agency beefed up security over fears of attempts to free the suspended commander of the Intelligence Response Team,&nbsp;&nbsp;DCP Abba Kyari&nbsp;and some of his men in custody.</p><p>Naija News reports that Abba Kyari has been in the custody of the anti-narcotics agency since Monday for allegedly dealing in cocaine trafficking.</p><p>A top commander of the&nbsp;Islamic State’s West Africa Province&nbsp;(ISWAP), Mallam Buba Danfulani, has been gunned down by troops of the&nbsp;Nigerian Army.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that Danfulani and some ISWAP fighters were killed by an airstrike conducted by the Nigerian military along the fringes of Lake Chad in Borno State on Sunday, February 13.</p><p>The ISWAP leader was said to be in a meeting with his lieutenants when the airstrike was executed at the East of Madayi in the Kukawa Local Government Area of the state.</p><p>Nigerians have condemned the Federal Government over the increase in the electricity tariff by&nbsp;Electricity Distribution Companies&nbsp;(DisCos) in the country.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;learned that the&nbsp;Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission&nbsp;(NERC) had adjusted the electricity tariffs been paid to DisCos, which invariably means that the tariffs have been hiked.</p><p>It was gathered that some of the distribution companies saw an increase in their tariffs, while others got theirs reduced. Checks by this platform show that the silent increase wasn’t announced or published on the NERC website.</p><p>The ordeal of the former head of the IGP Intelligence Response Team,&nbsp;Abba Kyari&nbsp;seems not to be ending anytime soon as the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has filed a court application seeking an extension to detain him.</p><p>The suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police is been interrogated by NDLEA alongside four other police operatives that were involved in an alleged drug trafficking.</p><p>Kyari who in time past had been described by Nigerians as a super cop has seen his name dragged in the mud due to different allegations levelled against him in the past few weeks.</p><p>The faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) loyal to former Kano Governor&nbsp;Ibrahim Shekarau&nbsp;has vowed to challenge the ruling of the Court of Appeal.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that the Appeal Court on Thursday&nbsp;ruled against&nbsp;the emergence of the APC faction in the state which has Ahmadu Haruna Zago as its Chairman.</p><p>The court then proceeded to uphold the appeal by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje-led faction of the party and set aside the judgment of the FCT High Court for lack of jurisdiction.</p><p>Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has slammed media mogul, Raymond Dokpesi, for allegedly spreading false news about governors elected on the platform of the&nbsp;Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).</p><p>Wike, in a statement on Thursday by his Special Assistant, Media, Kelvin Ebiri, denied a text message allegedly sent by Dokpesi claiming PDP governors travelled to Europe to pick the party’s&nbsp;presidential and vice-presidential candidates for the 2023 election.</p><p>Wike urged former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, whom Dokpesi is backing for the 2023 presidency, to prevail on the media mogul to stop spreading rumours that will polarise PDP governors and stakeholders.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.

The parents to this talented soul were Robert Williams and Laurie Williams. The American stand-up comedian’s dad was a senior executive in Ford Motor Company's Lincoln-Mercury Division, whereas his mother was a former model from Jackson, Mississippi. The humour that Robin developed was attributed to him trying to make his mother laugh, to get her attention.</p><p class=align-left>Williams's friends from the Gorton Elementary School and Deer Path Junior High School recall him as a funny guy. He outlived his shyness once he joined the drama club department. The American comedian also excelled in school and even got elected as the class president. He later joined Claremont Men's College to study political science but dropped out. The choice he made was for an acting pursuit at College of Marin.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Actress Brett Somers bio: children, husband, death</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/09cbf012804faf0e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Matt James, the first Black 'Bachelor' 25 in 2021?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Taking care of each step of his career, Robin started as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a stand-up comedian</a> where he got critics of his work being simple. However, that did not stop him. He did some outstanding acts such as "The Night of the Iguana". His successful performance on television and his stand-up comedy shows made his career grow day by day. Not to forget his best-selling movies that grossed a lot of money.</p><h2>Wife and children</h2><p class=align-left>Family is a pillar and gives a sense of belonging to any individual. Apart from his parents, Robin had a family. Before William died, he had married his third wife, Susan Schneider on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">October 23, 2011</a>. Susan Schneider is a graphic designer, and the two lived at their house in Sea Cliff.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, he had earlier married his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first wife Valerie Velardi</a> with whom they were blessed with a son Zachary Pym. They later divorced in 1988. Marsha Garces (his second wife), had two children, Zelda Rae Williams and Cody Alan Williams. They also divorced in 2010. Well, marriage seemed a hard knot for Williams to tie; his children were of his best interest.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/209933e71b417bcf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Taylor Zakhar Perez biography: age, parents, net worth, girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Williams, at one time, stated, <i>"My children give me a great sense of wonder.

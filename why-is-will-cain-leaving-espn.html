Does it have to do with politics?</h2><p>While Will has certainly made his political views known in the past, it didn't seem to hinder his growth at the network one bit. In fact, despite being a neophyte in sports broadcasting, Will eventually became a third panelist for<a href=#> First Take, ESPN's morning sports debate program</a>. He then was given the reins to his own national afternoon radio talk show. Not bad for a few years of work.</p><p>Interestingly, ESPN had quickly become maligned by staunch conservatives as being too "left leaning", and even became a subject of attack from the president himself when<a href=#> Jemele Hill</a> called Donald Trump a white supremacist.&nbsp;</p><p>ESPN had to pay her off to distance themselves from the personality, and now Jemele writes for The Atlantic and hosts her own podcast.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Will Cain (@cwillcain)</a> on Sep 13, 2019 at 5:42am PDT</p></figure><p>There were some ESPN employees, like Dan Le Batard, who overtly referred to Will Cain and suggested that the network primarily favors conservative prospective workers over liberal ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Other high-profile figures at ESPN thought it was important to bring someone with Will's background and viewpoints into the network's fold, including Jimmy Pitaro.</p><p>"When I look at this topic — the criticism that we’re left-leaning — my job is to bring on people who have different thoughts.
